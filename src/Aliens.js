    summary:
      "On a show like Ben 10, good old-fashioned coolness matters a lot, and the coolest of the Omnitrix aliens was XLR8. As his name implies, XLR8, a member of the Kineceleran species, possessed super speed. This meant XLR8 was not only plenty useful in a fight, but in many ways, the Omnitrix alien most useful for practical, everyday purposes.",
    info: "Though the most fragile next to Stinkfly, his speed makes up for it. Combine that with an awesome design, namely a cyborg kangaroo/velociraptor hybrid with a striking blue-and-black color scheme, and XLR8 is the clear victor for the title of best Ben 10 alien.",

    summary:
      "Diamondhead isn't the only inorganic alien in the Omnitrix. Upgrade, a Galvanic Mechamorph, was composed of nano-machines that, together, formed a vaguely humanoid blob with a cyclopean head. This meant Upgrade's design struck a balance of humanoid and alien, with the green-and-black grid lines along his body a hint at his technological origins.",
    info: "Said origins reflected how Upgrade had one of the most useful abilities in the Omnitrix — technopathy, the ability to possess machines and alter them to his will. For more direct fighting, his viscous body granted him superhuman flexibility, and he could shoot a powerful laser beam from his single eye.",

He could reshape his body, form weapons from his limbs, launch smaller crystals as projectiles, or create new crystal constructs altogether. In the sequel series Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben even used Diamondhead to soundly defeat Vilgax. ",

      "In the series premiere 'And Then There Were 10,' the first alien Ben transformed into after he found the Omnitrix was Heatblast. The Omnitrix's sample of the Pyronite species, Heatblast, was essentially a being of living magma. He also more than lived up to Ben's name for him, being able to generate and shoot fire from all across his body.",
    info: "As a bonus, his pyrokinesis enabled him to fly by means of combustive force. The one drawback was that Ben couldn't always control the heat this form generated, but practice made perfect.",
